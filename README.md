# Conway's Game Of Life

<br>
This project was created using RCA, Javascript, React Router, immer library and CSS.

##Rules:
<br>

        1. A living cell will stay alive if 2 or 3 neighbours are alive.</li>
        2.  dead cell will come alive if exactly 3 neighbours are living.</li>

        3.Cells with less than 2 neighbours will die of underpopulation, cells
          with 4 or more neighbours will die of overpopulation.

        4.All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other
          dead cells stay dead.

<br>
      
          Player can click on any cell to make a custom pattern then click on
          the "Start" button to initiate a simulation. Click on Stop to pause.
          While running clicking on cells is disabled.
        
          - Player can use the "Random" button to generate a random number of live
          cells onto the grid.
        
          - Player can use the "Start/Stop" button to initiate or stop a
          simmulation.
     
          - Player can clear the previous grid with the "Clear" button.</li>
     
          - Player can see the simulation one generation at a time by clicking on
          the "Next Generation" button.
        
          - "Preset" button has a cell pattern that Player can activate and see
          how the patterns change but never die.
